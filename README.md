# Dhumbal
This is a Nepali card game I am working on called "Dhumbal". I am sure you'll find instructions to play this game if you google it. 
Basically you goal is to reduce the total sum of cards in your hand, and show it at the end if your total is less than 5, and you are
sure that no other player has their total that's less than or equal to yours. 

The game is started by distributing 7 cards to all 4 players. The player next to the distributer starts the game by throwing a single card, 
double or a double-run cards and pick one from the deck. The next player does the same, and any player gets to pick a card thrown by 
previous player if he has already thrown a double or a double-run.

I am building this android game in Android Studio 2.2.

You're welcome to fork it and submit a commit if you think you found a better logic.

Thanks.
